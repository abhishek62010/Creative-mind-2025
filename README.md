# Creative-mind-2025
A fun, open-source project where we come together to build a creative and interactive webpage from scratch. Everyone can contribute ideas, code, and designs to shape it into something unique. Letâ€™s turn imagination into reality! ðŸš€âœ¨


# Cartoon Webpage Starter

This is a simple cartoon-style webpage project, set up for deployment on GitHub Pages.

## Project Structure
```
Creative-mind-2025/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html      # Main HTML file
â”œâ”€â”€ style.css       # Stylesheet for the page
â””â”€â”€ script.js       # JavaScript for interactive elements
```

## Deployment Instructions
1. **Ensure file names are correct** â€” `index.html` must be in lowercase and in the root directory.
2. Place `style.css` and `script.js` in the same folder as `index.html`.
3. Commit and push all changes to the `main` branch.
4. GitHub Pages will automatically build and deploy your site.

## Notes
- If you see a 404 error after pushing, wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to finish building.
- Make sure your file references in `index.html` match exactly:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
<script src="script.js"></script>
```
